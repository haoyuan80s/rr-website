        <p>Hey there! 👋 By using our Ribbit Ribbit app, website, or podcast (we call them “Services”), you’re on board
            with
            these
            terms. Let’s hop right in! 🐸</p>

        <strong>Copyright Stuff 💼</strong>
        <p>We worked hard on this! Please don’t copy, share, or tweak our stuff without asking. Thanks, you’re
            awesome!
            😎</p>

        <strong>Updates? Yep! 🔄</strong>
        <p>We’ll update the Services when needed. Keep things fresh by grabbing the latest version!</p>

        <strong>Privacy First 🔐</strong>
        <p>Your data = your business. We follow GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, and PECR to keep it safe. Just keep your
            device
            secure (no jailbreaks, okay?). 😉</p>

        <strong>Internet Things 🌐</strong>
        <p>Need internet for full functionality! And yep, your mobile provider might charge you if you're using
            data.
            Double-check your plan, especially when roaming! 📱💸</p>

        <strong>Oops!</strong>
        <p>We try to keep things smooth, but if your phone dies or you lose connection, well, we can’t help with
            that!
            🔋🤷</p>

        <strong>We Make Changes 📝</strong>
        <p>Sometimes, we update these terms. Keep an eye here for any changes. Still using the Services? You’re
            cool
            with the new terms!</p>

        <strong>Say Hi! ✉️</strong>
