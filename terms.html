        <div>Hey there! 👋 By using our Ribbit Ribbit app, website, or podcast (we call them
            "Services"), you're on
            board
            with
            these
            terms.
        </div>

        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">Copyright Stuff 💼</div>
        <div>We worked hard on this! Please don't copy, share, or tweak our stuff without asking. Thanks, you're
            awesome!
        </div>
        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">Updates? Yep! 🔄</div>
        <div>We'll update the Services when needed. Keep things fresh by grabbing the latest version!</div>

        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">Privacy First 🛡️</div>
        <div>We care about your privacy (like, a lot), so here's the lowdown on how we handle your data in the app:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Browsing Around: Feel free to explore and search through all the
                    papers you want without
                    logging in. You're totally anonymous here!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Time to Interact: Want to vote, leave a comment, save a paper, or
                    doodle all over a paper
                    PDF? You'll need to log in for those. We keep things simple with Google and Apple login.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Login Stuff: When you log in, we only get an encrypted user ID
                    from
                    Google or Apple so we can
                    keep your account consistent. That's it. We're not interested in your email or anything else
                    personal.
                </li>
            </ul>
            We follow GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, and PECR to keep it safe. Just keep your device secure (no jailbreaks,
            okay?). 😉
        </div>

        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">Internet Things 🌐</div>
        <div>Need internet for full functionality! And yep, your mobile provider might charge you if you're
            using data. Double-check your plan, especially when roaming! 📱💸</div>

        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">Oops!</div>
        <div>We try to keep things smooth, but if your phone dies or you lose connection, well, we can't
            help with that! 🔋🤷</div>

        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">We Make Changes 📝</div>
        <div>Sometimes, we update these terms. Keep an eye here for any changes. Still using the
            Services? You're cool with the new terms!</div>

        <div class="highlightText" style="padding: 10px 0;">Say Hi! ✉️</div>
