    <div>Hey there! 👋 By using our Ribbit Ribbit app, website, or podcast (we call them
        "Services"), you're on
        board
        with
        these
        terms.
    </div>

    <div class="highlightNumber" style="padding: 10px 0;">Copyright Stuff 💼</div>
    <div>We worked hard on this! Please don't copy, share, or tweak our stuff without asking. Thanks, you're
        awesome!
    </div>
    <div class="highlightNumber" style="padding: 10px 0;">Updates? Yep! 🔄</div>
    <div>We'll update the Services when needed. Keep things fresh by grabbing the latest version!</div>

    <div class="highlightNumber" style="padding: 10px 0;">Privacy First 🔐</div>
    <div>We follow GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, and PECR to keep it safe. Just keep your device secure (no jailbreaks,
        okay?). 😉
    </div>

    <div class="highlightNumber" style="padding: 10px 0;">Internet Things 🌐</div>
    <div>Need internet for full functionality! And yep, your mobile provider might charge you if you're
        using data. Double-check your plan, especially when roaming! 📱💸</div>

    <div class="highlightNumber" style="padding: 10px 0;">Oops!</div>
    <div>We try to keep things smooth, but if your phone dies or you lose connection, well, we can't
        help with that! 🔋🤷</div>

    <div class="highlightNumber" style="padding: 10px 0;">We Make Changes 📝</div>
    <div>Sometimes, we update these terms. Keep an eye here for any changes. Still using the
        Services? You're cool with the new terms!</div>
